// Time: "before I knew it, the summer coming-of-age ceremony had arrived."
// starbinding is mid summer and summer COA is final week of summer
// only ~15 days accounted for, so timeskip time
>>>1
// Time: "The autumn baptisms came soon after,"
// either 2 days or 9 days, 2 seems more "soon after"
// than 9
>>2,Morning
// hartmut gets more work



#The Harvest Festival and a Meeting
// Time: "The Harvest Festival arrived seemingly out of nowhere."
// ok this one really is deserving of a timeskip
// this is legitimately like 70+ days in a single chapter
// "so after traveling through the Central District"
// the pattern of this is pretty known but i'm not
// gonna bother putting it in because the book basically
// skipped over it at this point, which is understandable
// after 4? times of going through it
