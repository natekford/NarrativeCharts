#Prologue
// i don't think Sidonius is in the castle in this scene
// but it is worded kind of ambiguously that he could 
// have been in the castle
// i'm already not including most commuting, what more
// is having a character in the wrong place

#Visiting Groschel and the Starbind Ceremony
// Time: "right after the spring coming-of-age ceremony was over."
// ~16 days have passed between AD conf and now
// but only 76 days have passed between spring baptism and now
// so some time should probably be laundered in between
// spring baptism and ad conf instead of laundering it now
>>7,Morning
// Time: "two days after the summer baptism ceremony"
// Either 4 or 11 days later
// Spring COA happens on last 1st day of the week
// Summer bap happens on first 3rd day of the week
// so the difference will always either be 2 or 9 days
