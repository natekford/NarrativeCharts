See [here](https://github.com/natekford/NarrativeCharts/tree/master/samples/NarrativeCharts.Bookworm/Scripts) for examples of how scripts are written.

[NarrativeCharts.Console](https://github.com/natekford/NarrativeCharts/blob/master/src/NarrativeCharts.Console/Program.cs) can produce charts for scripts in a supplied directory (ScriptDefinitions.json must exist and all scripts in the directory will be processed).

Inspired by [XKCD 657: Movie Narrative Charts](https://xkcd.com/657/).
